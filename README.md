# Development_of_an_Underwater_Manipulator_System
This repository documents the development of an underwater manipulator. It includes the design methodology, material selection for mechanical construction, electronic system components, software development, and the physical assembly of the manipulator. Design files for the manipulator arm components and electrical connection diagrams are available in this repository. This project is part of the doctoral thesis of PhD Salatiel Garc√≠a Nava.

The proposed arm structure and link dimensions are presented below.
